# HCL-Group-2

In order for the project to run, there are two files you need to fill out:

  Capstone-Chris-main/ecommerce/src/main/resources/TEMPLATE application.properties
  
  Capstone-Chris-main/ecommerce/src/test/resources/TESTING TEMPLATE application.properties
  
  For each of these
  
    1. Make a copy of the file
    
    2. Rename the copy to application.properties
    
    3. Edit the file to fill in your credentials everywhere you see "<YOUR INFO HERE>"
    
    4.Don't delete the template file, just leave the original as is
  Then you should be good to go.
